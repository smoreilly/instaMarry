ideal

##Description
What we wear matters. How we look matters. Fashion has changed and there is no longer one way that we are supposed to dress. Every person from every background has a different idea of what is important to them. However, we often find it difficult to explain to others what clothing styles we prefer. Finding a partner who has a great personality is hard. When we meet that person, having them wear the right clothes should be easy. 

ideal is a social network where people can create and share their perfect partner's attire. Users can create their ideal by sharing apparel they find online and add items to their profile. They can also browse their friend's profiles and add items other people like. Lastly, they can find items they like out in the world, snap a picture and add those items to their profile. ideal creates a world where we don't have to worry about what to wear. A world where we don't have to be embarressed by our partners attire. Control your appearance. Create your ideal.
